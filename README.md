# Check-Yo-Self
Mod 1 Final Project

### Project Overview:
Check-Yo-Self was the final solo project for the first Module at Turing. The project is a To-Do List Application in which the user can create multiple to-do lists with however many tasks per list that they want. The individual tasks can be checked off once complete and when all tasks are complete the list can be deleted. Lists can be marked urgent in which case they appear in a different color and brought to the top of the page. There is also a search input where the user can find lists. The lists are stored in localStorage and persist upon page refresh.

### Project Goals:
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  DRY JavaScript
  localStorage to persist data
  
Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops.
Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM.


### Overview of technologies used, challenges, and wins, any other reflections
HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all used on this project with JavaScript being the main focus. The project uses both primitive and complex data types. Multiple classes are used for the list and the tasks within each list. LocalStorage is used to store primitive data types as well as object instances and arrays of object instances.
