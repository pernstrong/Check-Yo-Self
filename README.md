# Check-Yo-Self
Mod 1 Final Project

### Project Overview:
Check-Yo-Self was the final solo project for the first Module at Turing. The project is a To-Do List Application in which the user can create multiple to-do lists with however many tasks per list that they want. The individual tasks can be checked off once complete and when all tasks are complete the list can be deleted. Lists can be marked urgent in which case they appear in a different color and brought to the top of the page. There is also a search input where the user can find lists. The lists are stored in localStorage and persist upon page refresh.

### Project Goals:
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  DRY JavaScript
  localStorage to persist data
  
Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops.
Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM.


### Overview of technologies used, challenges, and wins, any other reflections
HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all used on this project with JavaScript being the main focus. The project uses both primitive and complex data types. Multiple classes are used for the list and the tasks within each list. LocalStorage is used to store primitive data types as well as object instances and arrays of object instances. 

There were many challenges faced throughout this project. This was my second project utilzing the data model and getting that set up correctly was a challenge. I had learned from past experience that it is super important to get this done up front so I put a strong emphasis on it this go around. I also did my best to keep the classes seperate and encapsulated which was also a challenge at times. 

The biggest challenge I came across during this project was objects behaving weirdly after being retrieved from Local Storage. It took me several hours and a ton of console logs to finally understand that the objects being retrieved were not the actual object instances. The difference in the console log was super sublte but someting I will definitely pay more attention to in the future. We did have a lesson on Monday that confirmed this for me. Although it was painful that I spent so much time struggling with this on my own, I am glad that I came to the correct conclusion before the lesson.

I feel that this entire project has been a win for me. The amount I learned over the past 5 weeks is incredible and I feel I was able to display most of it within this project. On the first Solo project I spent hours struggling with CSS. This time around it was not easy but I was much more efficient and utilized many tools and skills that I did not have before. While my JavaScript is far from good, I am proud of how far I have come since really using a lot of JavaScript in my second project, Intention Timer. On this project I actively thought while writing the functions if they followed SRP and DRY. Admittingly, I was not perfect and there are plenty of examples of how I could have refractored better, I am much more aware of these and have tried to fix them.
